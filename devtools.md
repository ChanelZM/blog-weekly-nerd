Let's be honest about one thing, if DevTools wouldn't exist, it would make our developers life's much more complicated. We can use it to access the console (such a powerful tool to debug), the html file (more debugging),css (guess what, more debugging) and to use it to change lines of code and seeing it live changing without changing it first in our local file and refreshing it again. These are the features every developer uses DevTools for.

But there is more to it than just the features mentioned above. And if you're a young developer that has a lot to learn, I suggest reading this article and getting to know DevTools better.

## Sources Tab
When you make changes to the code in the Elements tab, these changes will disappear when you refresh the page. In the source tab you can export your changes and save them. Just like your editor it will show a star after the filename when you've made changes in the file. Changes will be saved in browser storage (Codeschool, no date).
