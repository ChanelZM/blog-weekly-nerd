# Blog Weekly Nerd
## Introduction
During the minor Everything Web I followed, a developer visited us every Tuesday and had a talk about a particular subject. Sketch notes for every talk should then be collected in a blog. Out of all the talks 5 subjects were to be selected to write an article about.

In this repo all sketch notes (some are Dutch) are viewable along with the 5 written articles. At the end of this read me you can find links to these articles.

## Week 1
The first week Stephen Hay, designer and developer at CataWiki, had a question & answer.
