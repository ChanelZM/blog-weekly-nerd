# Blog Weekly Nerd
## Introduction
During the minor Everything Web I followed, a developer visited us every Tuesday and had a talk about a particular subject. Sketch notes for every talk should then be collected in a blog. Out of all the talks 5 subjects were to be selected to write an article about.

In this repo all sketch notes (some are Dutch) are viewable along with the 5 written articles. At the end of this read me you can find links to these articles.

## The topics i will be discussing
1. [Why it isn't the end of the world if you use div's every now and then](https://github.com/ChanelZM/blog-weekly-nerd/blob/master/usingdivs.md)
2. [An Introduction to Dev Tools](https://github.com/ChanelZM/blog-weekly-nerd/blob/master/devtools.md)
3. [Designer, learn to code (a little bit)](https://github.com/ChanelZM/blog-weekly-nerd/blob/master/designcode.md)
4. [A more detailed look at Web Animation API](https://github.com/ChanelZM/blog-weekly-nerd/blob/master/webanim.md)
5. [Getting to know Git more (undoing changes)](https://github.com/ChanelZM/blog-weekly-nerd/blob/master/git.md)
