## Designer, learn to code (a little bit)
![](https://uploads.gravitatedesign.com/legacy/designeranddeveloper.jpg)
During my second year studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam, I had to build a webshop with three other students. It was our first real client. In our team we had two designers, one developer and me, a developer and designer. At a point during our project one of the designers came up with an idea to build something that was impossible to create, because we didn't have the knowledge back then. The designer actually thought that it would be easy to make, forgetting that he hardly had any knowledge of code.

Not being able to accurately estimate what's possible is just one of the reasons why it doesn't hurt to know a little bit of code when you're a designer. Being a designer and knowing code has more pros than you think. Here's why.

## You'll get a better understanding of what's possible
Just as the designer I mentioned in my example a lot of the designers think something can be easily build. My coach once said "Designers gooien werk over de schutting" (Literal translation: "Designers throw work over the fence") meaning that a designer would create a design, pass it to the developer and then completely disappear without a lot of communication expecting it to be done in an impossible amount of time. Designers don't have enough knowledge about code.

So how can we close this enormous gap of no-communication-and-understanding? Right, by learning code! You don't have to be a genius, but I'm certain that just the slightest bit of code would help a designer to understand that creating a product that works takes so much more time than previously expected. Learning code will give you a different perspective.

## You can already begin with styling in the browser
Another pro if you're more comfortable with HTML and CSS is that you can already start with creating stuff in the browser instead of creating something static in Photoshop or Illustrator.

You'll also discover that there is so much more to style than you thought. You can now work with animations, transitions and hovers (all things you can not test in Illustrator or Photoshop). You could think about movement in general and have even more controll over your design.

Because you are now able to code you could just show the developer what you would want in a little demo you made. The developer will then have a better view on how the design should be and create it for production. The communication between you and the developer will be a lot more clear.

Last but not least, fixing minor problems can be done by you.

## You'll even be more valuable
Being a designer AND a developer is really valuable. Because you are now skilled in both disciplines you'll have more job opportunities. Companies are looking for people that know both practices.

Not only will you have more job opportunities, you will also be more valuable inside your team. If the developers have a hard time due to all of the projects you can help them out.

You'll be a unicorn, a developer and designer. Scott Moris even calls you cool! (Morris, S).

## What others said
These where my reasons why learning code has advantage but there a lot more reasons why starting code today is a really good decision, so if you're not entirely convinced maybe the next quotes will help you.

### It's timesaving
Someone from Treehouse stated:
> *"..once you reach the point in a project where you feel comfortable designing in the browser you instantly cut out all those Photoshop mock-ups you would have handed over to a coder, only to re-do in code what you’ve already done in Photoshop."*

### It opens up more creative possibilities
Someone from Treehouse stated:
> *"Far from being a restriction, it(learning code) opened up a whole new realm of creative possibilities. Basically, learning code made me a much better Web Designer."*

Scott Morris says in one of his articles:
> *"To stay on top of things as a designer, it’s important to keep that creativity honed. Learning new skills is one way to keep your mind agile when thinking about problems and their creative solutions."*

Monica Nakamine says:
> *"Creativity comes into play when that knowledge is applied – when you're able to string together notes or pieces of code to create something complex, intriguing and beautiful, like Beethoven's 5th Symphony or Grand Theft Auto V. In that same vein, approaching creativity through coding may help you explore new design possibilities."*

### Improved critical thinking
Scott Morris says:
> *"Among the many benefits from learning to code, improved critical thinking and problem solving stand tall in the pack."*

Jennifer Johnson says:
> *"Computer coding teaches students problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, math and collaboration"*
